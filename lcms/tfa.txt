Do not inject TFA and if you absolutely need to, it needs to be <0.01% (ie rotavap off the TFA, then do an aqueous workup). TFA has ion suppression properties and is known to strongly bind to components (read: ion pairing reagents) in the LCMS including tubing, ion source, and column. In general, avoid all ion pairing reagents (TFA is one of them) on the LCMS. TFA is rarely used with LCMS for these reasons - in lab environments where TFA is needed (eg for proteins), a dedicated machine is typical, which we do not have.

TFA is known to take months (some say years) to remove from an LC system. While my job is general maintenance of the LCMS, it is not to fix problems that arise from misuse. If you're thinking of injecting something harsh and you're unsure of compatibility, ask some with experience.
